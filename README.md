# To-do-list-application-console-based-
Features: View Tasks
Displays your entire to-do list in a clean, numbered format.
Shows a status for each task: [ ] for pending or [x] for complete.
Add Task
Lets you type in a new task to add to your list.
New tasks are automatically marked as "pending" [ ] by default.
Mark Task as Complete
Allows you to select a task by its number and change its status from pending [ ] to complete [x].
This lets you track accomplishments without permanently deleting the task
Remove Task
Permanently deletes a task from your list, which is useful for items you no longer need to track
Persistent Storage
The most important feature: the app automatically saves your list to a file (tasks_plus.txt)
When you close and restart the program, all your tasks and their statuses are reloaded, so your data is never lost
User-Friendly CLI (Command-Line Interface)
It presents a simple, numbered menu for easy navigation
The screen clears between actions to keep the interface tidy and easy to read
Includes basic error handling to prevent crashes if you accidentally enter text instead of a number
